# Drum-Kit
### Creating a Drum Kit using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I wanted to create my own drum kit. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br />
You can make different sounds with the mouse or by pressing the "w,a,s,d,j,k,l" keys on keyboard. <br />
You can see that my website is responsive to fit different screen sizes. <br /> 
You can also visit my website by clicking the link below and have some fun combining different sounds. <br />
Feel free to share your observations with me.
